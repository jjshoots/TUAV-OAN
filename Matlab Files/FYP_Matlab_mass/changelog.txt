V2
- Added in Velocity and Acceleration constraining in move.m and velocity.m

V3
- Added in Jerk constraining in velocity.m
- Added in dynamics logging

V4
- Look at closest TWO obstacles
- Modified distances.m to be a bit more efficient for concern.m
- Added in Snap and Pop, renamed velocity.m to dynamics.m
- Added ability to pull map from save files
- Added yaw control
- Avoidance vector for obstacles only kicks in when drone is less than 3 meters away from obstacle,
	at magnitude of 1/3 of normalized vector
	
V5
- Added in WORKING A* search algorithm, in heck_yes_a_star.m

V6
- Added in split and merge algorithm for A* search in split_and_merge.m
- New algo does a* -> path -> waypoints -> target
- Added in target parsing from waypoints
- Considered done

V7
- Fixed split and merge forming NaN, identified NaN when y=mx algo used for line forming algo forms
	vertical path, which causes m -> inf 

V8
- General bug fixes
